# wordstar-linux-manjaro-isotools
Wordstar Linux manjaro-tools repo

git clone manjaro-isotools, then duplicate an i3 dir that's in the community folder. 
Lastly, overwrite new folder with this project, and everything should work. I know--a shitty hack.
I'll fix later perhaps, but I just wanted to keep the scripts separate from this release.
